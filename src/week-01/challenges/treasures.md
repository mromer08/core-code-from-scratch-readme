# Find the treasure ğŸ‘‘
## Description
We are in a room with three chests. We know that at least one has a treasure in it. Each chest has a message, but all the messages are lies.

- Left chest: The middle chest has a treasure
- Middle chest: All these chests have treasures in them
- Right chest: Only one of these chests has treasures.

Which chests have treasures?

## Solution
**Denying the messages from the chests**

- Left chest: The middle chest don't have a treasure
- Middle chest: Not all of these chests have treasures in them
- Right chest: More than one of these chests has treasures.
