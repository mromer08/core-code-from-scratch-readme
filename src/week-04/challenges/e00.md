# Average sales and commission

## Description

Make a program that asks how many sales the seller had, Once the number of sales is entered, ask for the value of each sale until all are entered, then return as a result the average value of sales, and the commission that the seller will take, If the seller had more than 5 sales, his commission will be 15% of the total value of the sales, if he sold 5 or less, his commission will be only 10%.

# Solution
```python
Algoritmo averageSalesAndCommission
	Definir sales Como Entero
	Definir total, aux, commission Como Real
	sales <- 0
	total <- 0
	aux <- 0
	Imprimir "Write the total number of sales to enter:"
	Leer sales
	Para i <- 1 Hasta sales Hacer
		Imprimir "Write the value for the sale number ", ConvertirATexto(i)
		Leer aux
		total <- total + aux
	FinPara
	
	Si sales > 5 Entonces
		commission <- 0.15 * total
	SiNo
		commission <- 0.10 * total
	FinSi
	
	Imprimir "The average sales is: ", ConvertirATexto(total/sales)
	Imprimir "The commission received by the seller is: ", ConvertirATexto(commission)
