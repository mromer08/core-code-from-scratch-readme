# Toss coin
## Description

From the data we receive first a name and a value, then another name and another value, using the built-in function aleatorio() we simulate the flip of a coin, We must return the name of the winner in capital letters and the value I win, to avoid cheating, if a player puts a value of zero or negative, the opponent automatically wins, in case both cheat, "game canceled" is returned.

# Solution
```python
Algoritmo tossCoin
	Imprimir "Enter the name of the first player:"
	Leer player1
	Imprimir Mayusculas(player1), ", enter the amount to play:"
	Leer amountPlayer1
	Imprimir "Enter the name of the second player:"
	Leer player2
	Imprimir Mayusculas(player2), ", enter the amount to play:"
	Leer amountPlayer2
	
	Si amountPlayer1 <= 0 & amountPlayer2 <= 0 Entonces
		Imprimir "Game canceled"
	SiNo
		Si amountPlayer1 <= 0 Entonces
			Imprimir "Winner: ", Mayusculas(player2)
		SiNo
			Si amountPlayer2 <= 0 Entonces
				Imprimir "Winner: ", Mayusculas(player1)
			SiNo
				random <- Aleatorio(0,1)
				Si random == 0 Entonces
					Imprimir "Winner: ", Mayusculas(player1), " Amount won: ", amountPlayer2
				SiNo
					Imprimir "Winner: ", Mayusculas(player2), " Amount won: ", amountPlayer1
				FinSi
			FinSi
