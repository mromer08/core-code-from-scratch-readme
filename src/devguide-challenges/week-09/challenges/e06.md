[Convert string to camel case](https://www.codewars.com/kata/517abf86da9663f1d2000003)

## Helpful Resources

1. [String To Upper Case - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)
2. [Array Reduce - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)

# Exercise
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be always capitalized.
### Examples

`"the-stealth-warrior"` gets converted to `"theStealthWarrior"`
`"The_Stealth_Warrior"` gets converted to `"TheStealthWarrior"`

# Solution
This is the same kata that [week-08](../../week-08/challenges/e12.md) but this time i gonna to trying to refactor my previous code.
```js
function toCamelCase(str){
      var regExp=/[-_]\w/ig;
      return str.replace(regExp,function(match){
            return match.charAt(1).toUpperCase();
       });
}
```
