# Boolean results

## Description

You have been assigned to verify and explain a code created by one of your colleagues, the idea is that you can describe the value that each variable has within the code as well as what was done for each line. What is expected of you is that you add comments below each line showing the value that the variable would have and a short explanation of how that value is reached.

This is the code:

```python
Algoritmo boolean
	a <- 5 == 3
	// a <- false because 5 isn't equal to 3.
	b <- 4 <> 3
	// b <- true because 4 is different to 3.
	c <- 7 > 7
	// c <- false, because 7 isn't greater than itself, it's equal.
	d <- 4 < 4
	// d <- false, because 4 isn't less than itself, it's equal.
	e <- 100 <= 90
	// e <- false, because 100 is greater than 90.
	f <- 40 >= 40
	// f <- true, the operator is greater than or equal to, therefore 40 is included
