# Node.JS Module System

## Description

Now that you have a clearer concept about what Node.JS is, it's time to
practice with one of its most important concepts: The Module System.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is a Javascript Module?
2. Why are Javascript Modules necessary?
3. What module standards are available in Node.JS?
4. What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJS modules?
5. Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of the module system, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.
