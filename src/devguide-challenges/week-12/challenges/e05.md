# HTTP Learning Exercise

## Description

Before you can start building Web applications that implement the client-server model, it's important that you know, understand, and can explain why HTTP is such a fundamental technology for the Web.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is HTTP?
2. What is a Communication Protocol?
   - Do humans use communication protocols?
3. What is a Request in HTTP?
4. What is a Response in HTTP?
5. What is an HTTP method?
6. What are HTTP request headers?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of REST, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.
