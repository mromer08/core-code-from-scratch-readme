# From JSON to REST

## Description

Now that you know a little better what an API is, it's time to learn  
about one of the most popular ways to create an API for web applications, REST APIs.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is JSON?
   - Is JSON the same as a plain Javascript object?
2. What is REST?
   - Is REST a programming language, framework, technology, or architecture pattern?
3. What is a Resource in REST?
   - What is a resource identifier?
4. How are HTTP and REST related?
   - What HTTP methods does REST use within its architecture rules?
   - Why do we use HTTP methods in REST and how do they relate to resources?
5. Is REST the same as HTTP?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of REST, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.
