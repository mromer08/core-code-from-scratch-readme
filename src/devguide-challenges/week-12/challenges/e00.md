# Node.JS Core Understanding

## Description

Understanding well what Node.JS is before starting to use it, will make it
much easier for us to work with this powerful tool. In this exercise your task
is to answer the following questions in your own words:

1.  What is Node.JS?
    - What is NPM?
2.  What problem does Node.JS solve (Is there any problem that can be solved with Node.JS ðŸ¤”)?
3.  What is the V8 Javascript Engine?
4.  Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?
    - Why not use PHP or Golang?
5.  What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?
    - Are Node.JS and a browser the same?
6.  What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of Node.JS, so before answering the questions, meet
or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers as a group and
refine your final answers.
