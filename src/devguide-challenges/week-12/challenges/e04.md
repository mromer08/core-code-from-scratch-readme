# Client-Server Model

## Description

Having a solid understanding of how the communication between a
client and server is carried out will give you greater visibility
of how the web currently works.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is a Server?
2. What is a Client?
3. Is a server just another physical computer?
   - Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?
   - What is the difference?
4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?
   - List some examples
5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?
   - Do desktop applications use the client-server model?
   - Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of the client-server model, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.
