# Delayed Response API ⏳:

Create a simple REST API that receives a request containing a number that represents a delay  
in milliseconds. The API should respond to the request after the delay specified
in the request has expired.

## API Requeriments:

- Use Express JS to build the API.
- Use any port you want for the API.
- The API should use route parameters to get the desired delay:

  ```bash
    # Request example
    # Here 3000 indicates a delay of 3000 milliseconds
    http://localhost:3000/api/delay/3000
  ```

- Your API should have just one request handler.
- You can send any response you want after the delay has expired.
- If no delay is provided in the request, the API should use 1000 as default.
