# Node.JS Hello World - Practice

## Prerequisites

0. Make sure Node.JS is installed in your computer.
   You can enter the command `node -v` in a command terminal to check if Node.JS is installed.

## Description

Time to get our hands a little dirty and build our first Node.JS application üòÅ.

### Practice

0. Open a new command terminal on your computer.
1. Create a new folder in your computer and name it as: `hello_world_node`
2. Go to the folder you just created.
3. Execute the command `npm init` and answer the question you see in the terminal to create your Node.JS Project
4. Create a new file and name it as: `hello_world_node.js`
5. Make a `console.log` inside the file with whatever message you want.
6. Run your program by entering the command: `node hello_world_node.js`.

### Analyze Your Practice

0. Why do we run the `npm init` command and not `node init` to create a new Node.JS project?

1. When you entered the `npm init` command and answered the questions you saw in the terminal, a new file called `packacke.json` was generated.

- What does this file do?
- Why is this file generated?
