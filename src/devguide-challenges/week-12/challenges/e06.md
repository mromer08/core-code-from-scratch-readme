# APIs Core Understanding

## Description

We are sure you've heard the word API many times before, but
do you know what an API is?

Knowing what an API really is will help you understand how important
structured communication between two different programs is and what
options currently exist to achieve such communication.

Please answer the following questions with your own words:

1. What is an API?
2. What is a Protocol?
3. Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?
4. Why is structured communication between two programs important?
   - Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?
5. Is an API just another program or a standard?
6. Do you know any API? Can you list at least 5 examples of APIs?

It's important to share your opinion with the team and thus be able to
form your own concept of the APIs, so before answering the
questions, meet or chat with at least two colleagues and discuss the answers
as a group and refine your final answers.
