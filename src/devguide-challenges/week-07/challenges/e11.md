# Exercise
You have access to the ship "draft" and "crew". "Draft" is the total ship weight and "crew" is the number of humans on the ship.

Each crew member adds `1.5` units to the ship draft. If after removing the weight of the crew, the draft is still more than `20`, then the ship is worth looting. Any ship weighing that much must have a lot of booty!

Add the method
```
isWorthIt
```
to decide if the ship is worthy to loot. For example:
```js
titanic.isWorthIt() // return false
```
This Kata teaches you the very basics of method creation.

Good luck!

```js
function Ship(draft,crew) {
    this.draft = draft;
    this.crew = crew;
}
   
   //YOUR CODE HERE...
```
# Solution

```js
function Ship(draft,crew) {
    this.draft = draft;
    this.crew = crew;
}
   
   //YOUR CODE HERE...
Ship.prototype.isWorthIt = function () {
    return this.draft - (this.crew * 1.5) > 20;
}
```

> Notice that an Object can be create over a function :0 And remember the atribute prototype!!!!
