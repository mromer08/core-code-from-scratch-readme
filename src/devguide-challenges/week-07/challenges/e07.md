# Exercise
This function should return an object, but it's not doing what's intended. What's wrong?

```js
function mystery() {
  var results =
    {sanity: 'Hello'};
  return
    results;
}
```

# Solution

```js
/*
* I think that the identation was wrong, and the name. But I
* see some solutions where only change de identation in the  
* code, so I dont think the variable's name was the problem
*/

function mystery() {
  let obj = {sanity: 'Hello'};
  return obj;
}
```
