# Logic problem
## Description
The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday". <br>
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".<br>
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".<br>
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".<br>
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

## Solution
Alices is lying because if nobody studied math yesterday is true then Alice should to have study. Therefore there is an ambiguity.

Then all of they, exept Alice, are telling the truth.

> Bob, Charlie, Dan and Eva are telling the truth.
